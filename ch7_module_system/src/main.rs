    1) The module system: 
        packages(a cargo feature), 
        crates(a tree of modules), 
        modules
        paths

    2) Concepts
    - Crate: the smallest amount of code that the Rust compiler considers at a time.
        - Binary crates: programs you can compile to an executable.
        - Library crates: functionality intended to be shared with multiple projects.
    - Crate root: a source file that the Rust compiler starts from.
    - Package: a bundle of one or more crates that provides a set of functionality.
        - can contain multiple binary crates but only one library crate.
        - must contain at least one crate.
